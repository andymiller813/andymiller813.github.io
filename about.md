Hello there!  My name is Andy Miller and I am an Android Developer and Entrepreneur.  Currently, I am working for Nike on the Nike+ Running Android App.

I graduated from Oregon State University in 2013 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, and directly out of school I went on to try to start my own company making an Android mobile app called [Pikly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.playpulse.tally).  Although the app ultimately has failed at this point, it was an experience of a life time and I wouldn't trade it for anything!  We were interviewed by Alexis O'hanian, the co-founder of Reddit, made the front page of the Corvallis newspaper a few times, and met hundreds of amazing and inspiring people in the Pacific Northwest.  Some amazing times, indeed!  

I hope you enjoy my blog as it continues to grow.  Feel free to reach out with questions at any point through various social media outlets you can find on this site, or by E-Mail.
