##Introduction
Binary, also known as Base-2, is a number system, just like the Dewey Decimal system that we all learned in kindergarten - counting 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.  The only difference is that the decimal system has 10 characters to utilize:  **(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)** while the binary system only uses two characters - **0** and **1**.  It just so happens that binary is the basis of computers and the *entire* internet as we know it.  In this post, I will go into detail about how to count in binary, how to convert between binary and decimal and vice versa, and what [the heck] binary has to do with computers and the internet.  In order to fully understand computers and programming, understanding binary is a *critical* step, even at the beginner level.  

##Counting in Binary
Counting in binary is just like counting in decimal, it just requires a little bit more abstracted thinking.  Let's start counting in binary... remember we only have '0' and '1'
